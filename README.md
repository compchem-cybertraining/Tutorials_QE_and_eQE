# Tutorials_QE_and_eQE
Tutorials on Quantum Espresso (QE) and embedded QE (eQE)

* 1_md - demonstrates computing 50 steps of MD for ethylene molecule with QE package and also MD for CO2

* 2_delta-scf - demonstrates how to fix the occupation numbers and perform the delta-SCF calculations of 
        the excited states for ethylene molecule of course

* 3_pdos 
          demonstrates how to compute pDOS and post-process it using Libra
          is the fresh setup for more complex system, similar to ex3, also demonstrates the nscf calculations (for pDOS calculations, but only internally by QE)


* 4_normal_modes - is a demonstration of the normal modes calculations with QE

* 5_interactive_qe - running QE from the Jupyter notebook
