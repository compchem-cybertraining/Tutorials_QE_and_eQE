*  step1 - MD of LiH

*  step2 - running QE and NAC calculations interactively in a notebook
   step2a - same as step2, but a more streamlined example
   step2b - yet another version of the NAC calculations, but now without Jupyter, just distributed computings

*  step3 - computing NACs in the basis of SDs

*  step4 - conducting NA-MD itself
