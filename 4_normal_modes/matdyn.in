! q_in_band_form if .true. the q points are given in band form
! Only the first and last point of one or more lines are given.
! Forms:
! nq
! (q(i,n),i=1,3), nptq   

! nq: number of q points
! nptq is the number of points between this point and the next. These points are automatically
! generated. the q points are given in Cartesian coordinates, 2pi/a units (a=lattice parameters)
